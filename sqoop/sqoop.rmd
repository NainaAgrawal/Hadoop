- Run **sqoop help** to see a list of all tools.
- Run **sqoop help _tool name_ _[tool-option]_** for help using specific tools.
- Basic Syntax of sqoop invocation  : ***sqoop tool-name [tool-option]***.

- This command will list all tables of the database. 
        **sqoop list-tables** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set )
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
      
- **The import-all-tables tool imports an entire database:**
   - Stored as comma-delimited files.
   - Default base location is your HDFS home directory.
   - Data will be in subdirectories corresponding to name of each table.
        **sqoop import-all-tables** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)

- You can aslo use the ***--warehouse-dir*** option to specify a different base directory
        **sqoop import-all-tables** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--warehouse-dir /name of the database** (The ***--warehouse-dir*** (specifies the parent folder)option is used for multiple tables, but a ***--target-dir*** (specify the actual folder) option is also available that can be used for importing a single table.
        
- The import tool imports a single table.
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        
     -This Variation writes tab-delimited fields instead:
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--fields-terminated-by "\t"** (Use the double quote when specifying the
delimiter, so the command works well in both command line and in Oozie.)

        
- __INCREMENTAL IMPORTS__
  - What if records have changed since last import?
    - could re-import all records, but this is inefficient.
           
- **Sqoop's incremental _lastmodified_ mode imports new and modified records
  - Based on a timestamp in a specified column 
  - you must ensure timestsamps are updated when records are added or changed in the database
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--incremental lastmodified** \
        **--check-column mod_dt** \ (in place of mod_dt type the name of the column)
        **--last-value '2015-09-30 16:00:00'**
        
- **Or use Sqoop's incremental _append_ mode to import only new records**
  -Based on value of last record in specified coloumn
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--incremental append** \
        **--check-column id** \ (in place of id type the name of the column)
        **--last-value 9226458  **
        
- __IMPORTING PARTIAL TABLES__
  - Import only specified columns from a table.
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--columns "id,first_name,last_name,state"**(in "" mention the name of the columns that you want to import.)
   
- Import only matching rows from accounts table
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--Where "state ='CA'"**
    
- You can also import the results of a query, rather than a single table.
 - You must add the literal __WHERE $CONDITIONS__ token.
  - Use ***--split-by*** to identify field used to divide work among mappers.
  - The ***--target-dir*** option is required for free-form queries.
        **sqoop import** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--target-dir /data/loudacre/payable** \ (a ***--target-dir*** (specify the actual folder) option is also available that can be used for importing a single table.)
        **split-by accounts.id** ( in place of account.id mention the field name by which you want the work to be divided among the mappers)
        **query 'SELECT accounts.id, first_name, last_name FROM accounts JOIN invoices ON (account.id = invoices.cust_id) WHERE $CONDITIONS'** 
        
(• The string ‘WHERE $CONDITIONS’ need to be typed explicitly. This is where Sqoop itself will insert its range conditions for each tasks. $CONDITIONS does not include any of your own filtering conditions.
• Use the ‘AND’ to specify your own filtering criteria.
• When using --query, don’t combine with --columns or --where, they will be disregarded.
• The --target-dir option is required for free from queries so to remove the ambiguity          of possible multiple tables as output.
• Note the use of single quotes in the --query parameter: this is to avoid Unix to                 interpret $CONDITIONS as a variable.)

- The --where option is ignored in a free-form query.
  -you must specify your criteria using AND following the WHERE clause.      
        **sqoop import** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--target-dir /data/loudacre/payable** \ (a ***--target-dir*** (specify the actual folder) option is also available that can be used for importing a single table.)
        **split-by accounts.id** ( in place of account.id mention the field name by which you want the work to be divided among the mappers)
        **query 'SELECT accounts.id, first_name, last_name, bill_amount FROM accounts JOIN invoices ON (account.id = invoices.cust_id) WHERE $CONDITIONS' AND bill_amount >= 40**  
  
- Sqoop's export tool pulls records from HDFS into RDBMS
        **sqoop import** \
        **--connect jdbc:mysql://name of the server/name of the database** \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
        **--export-dir /loudacre/recommender_output** \ 
        **--update-mode allowinsert** \
        **--table name_of_the_table**
***NOTE*** (The --update-mode can be set to upsert which inserts a row if the record is not found or update its values otherwise. If you only want to update existing records you can use updateonly.)

- By default, sqoop typically importa data using four parallel tasks(called mappers)
  -You can influence the number of tasks using th -m option
        **sqoop import --table name_of_the_table** \
        **connect jdbc:mysql://name_of_the server/name_of_the_database \
        **--username training** \(in place of training enter the username that you have set)
        **--password pw** (in place of pw enter the password that you have set)
