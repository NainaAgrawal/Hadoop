Cluster: Hadoop can run in 3 modes: Standalone Mode, Pseudo distributed Mode and Fully Distributed mode
In seudo-distributed mode: This mode is almost simalr to FDM. all daemons run in one machine but they are running in different Jvm's.
In Standalone Mode: It doesn't have any daemons running. Its only for testing purposes.

If you press **tab** while entering commands in lfs. Then tab will complete the file path. But in case of hdfs you have to enter the command maually and tab doesn't work there.

If a command is too long then **\** will let you continue the command in next line.

To check the version of hadoop the command is **Hadoop Version**

To clear the terminal : ** Clear **

To check the health of the root directory of hdfs : ** Fsck / ** (/ = root directory)

To check the list of the all the files present in the hadoop root directory: hdfs dfs -ls /
