Hadoop is case sensitive.

**Abbreviations used**

Jvm : Java Virtual Machine.
LFS: Local File System
HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System

**Color Reference:**
Blue color: Folder
Black color: File
purple color: Image
Green color: Inbuilt app, you can use only cat function to view not ls function to check list.

Cluster: Hadoop can run in 3 modes: Standalone Mode, Pseudo distributed Mode and Fully Distributed mode
In seudo-distributed mode: This mode is almost simalr to FDM. all daemons run in one machine but they are running in different Jvm's.
In Standalone Mode: It doesn't have any daemons running. Its only for testing purposes.

**Tricks**

If you press **tab** while entering commands in lfs. Then tab will complete the file path. But in case of hdfs you have to enter the command maually and tab doesn't work there.

If a command is too long then **\** will let you continue the command in next line.

**Commands**

To check the version of hadoop the command is **Hadoop Version**

To clear the terminal : ** Clear **

To check the health of the root directory of hdfs : ** Fsck / ** (/ = root directory)

To check the list of the all the files present in the hadoop root directory: hdfs dfs -ls /

The command **cd** lets you set or change a directory as default in lfs.

To create a new directory ** hdfs dfs -mkdir <path where you want to create the file> <name of the file>

To remove a directory or file ** hdfs dfs -rm -r <file path and name> **

To copy a file from lfs to hdfs **hdfs dfs -put <lfs file path> <hdfs store path>**

To read the content of a file ** hdfs dfs -cat <file path, file name>**

To retrieve a file from hadoop in lfs  **hdfs dfs -get <hdfs path> <lf path>**

To see the last few lines of a file ** hdfs dfs -cat <file path, file name> | tail -n 20**

To see the first few lines of a file ** hdfs dfs -cat <file path, file name> | head -n 20**

Common Errors:

If you try to create a file with an existing name then it will say 'file already exists'
